## Features
1. Developing a security system integrated with Twilio that will send an SMS notification to the user whenever door lock access is granted or denied.
2. Utilizing Notifee to send real-time notifications to the user regarding environmental conditions.
3. Assessing the usability of the power consumption monitoring feature in providing data on energy usage to promote energy efficiency and enable informed decision-making regarding energy consumption.
4. Evaluating the system's control features for devices such as outlets, bulbs, and fans, analyzing their performance in providing users with remote control and management options.
5. Assessing the functionality of environmental sensors integrated into the system, analyzing their capacity to detect and report environmental conditions.
6. Assessing the implementation and performance of two-factor authentication using RFID and face recognition technology, examining its functionality in enhancing the security of the smart home system and preventing unauthorized access.
7. Examining the automation capabilities of the system in response to data from the environmental sensors, such as automatically closing windows when rain is detected and activating a piezo alarm when the fire is detected and gas levels exceed a certain threshold.
